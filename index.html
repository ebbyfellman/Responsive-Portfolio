            <p class="aboutMe">My name is Ebony Fellman and I am a 40-year-old Colorado native. I have been married for
                18 years and I have two teenage children.
                I mention that first, because I feel as though all my accomplishments have been driven by my family. I
                am very proud of my children.
                My son is a wrestler and has a brown belt in martial arts. My daughter is an excellent dancer, and
                watching her dance is one of my
                favorite past times.</p>

            <p class="aboutMe">Most of my professional life has been spent in the technical support of clients and their
                software. I really enjoy troubleshooting and solving technical problems,
                and a few of my jobs have even included reading and updating code. </p>

            <p class="aboutMe">On a more personal note, I have many diverse interests and hobbies. I am a huge fan of
                the Food Network Channel and I love cooking
                different and interesting meals. This is probably because I enjoy eating different types of food. I am a
                fan of art and this summer
                I will be making a special visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, during a trip to New York. I am very
                much looking forward to it.
                I call myself a Podcast junkie because of my enthusiasm listening to podcasts during my commutes to and
                from work. I like topics ranging
                from the mysterious and bizarre, to crime documentaries, politics, science, and TED talks. Finally, I
                have very eclectic tastes in music.
                I would say that music is one of my prime motivating factors. </p>
